Max’s Mouse Movement Trainer is a game written in C++ that allows users to enhance their mouse skills in precision, movement, click speed, and accurate movement speed. The game displays a main menu that allows users to navigate to 4 mini games. The games are Falling Shapes, CPS Test, Random Circle, and Precision Trainer, each focusing on improving a different aspect of mouse agility. 
	The program’s code has an emphasis on class encapsulation, with each mini game and the main menu being their own respective classes. The program also uses Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML) as an external library used to display a window, graphics, and audio.
